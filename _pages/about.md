Welcome! I'm **Hao Zhang**, a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at the **University of Glasgow**, where I am supervised by **Prof. Michael Wemyss**.

I am an **algebraic geometer** investigating geometric objects through tools from **commutative** and **noncommutative algebra**. My work centers on **resolutions of singularities**, **deformation theory**, **curve invariants**, and their connections to **representation theory**. My research contributes to classification problems in the **Minimal Model Program**, with a focus on 3-fold singularities and their associated algebraic structures.

In my research, I combine deep algebraic techniques with **computational methods**. I use tools such as **GAP** and **SageMath** to verify algebraic computations, calculate dimensions of **Jacobi algebras**, and test conjectures. I also collaborated on the **OSCAR project** during the Computational Algebraic Geometry Workshop in Durham, focusing on intersection calculations of exceptional curves on surfaces and 3-folds. This computational approach enhances both theoretical understanding and experimentation in modern algebraic geometry.

In parallel, I explore the synergy between **pure mathematics and machine learning**, combining geometric and algebraic perspectives with computational approaches. I am particularly interested in:

- Geometric and algebraic structures of neural network function spaces  
- Multiview geometry and its algebraic foundations  
- Equivariance, symmetry, and invariant theory in machine learning  
- Topological data analysis and optimization on manifolds

## Current Projects

ðŸ“„ *Local Forms for the Double $$A_n$$ Quiver* ([arXiv:2412.10042](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10042)):  
Studies the noncommutative singularity theory of the double $$A_n$$ quiver, proving a monomialization result and identifying their correspondence to crepant resolutions of $$ cA_n $$ singularities.

ðŸ“„ *Gopakumarâ€“Vafa Invariants associated to* $$ cA_n $$ *Singularities* ([arXiv:2504.03139](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03139)):   
Develops and generalizes GV invariants to crepant partial resolutions, showing their connection to contraction algebras and Todaâ€™s formula.

ðŸ”¬ **Research Outlook**:  
I am currently working to **generalize the techniques and results** developed for $$ cA_n $$ singularities to **Type D and E compound Du Val (cDV) singularities**, including monomialization methods and computation of GV invariants.

## Interdisciplinary Work

ðŸ“Š I developed a **life expectancy prediction model** using U.S. state data from the 1970s, applying **Bayesian hierarchical modeling**, correlation analysis, and variable selection in **R**.

ðŸ“ˆ I conducted a **Python-based longitudinal data analysis** of NHS England antidepressant prescriptions (2021â€“2024), analyzing volume-cost trends, drug types, and regional variations.

ðŸ§® I integrate **computational software** like GAP and SageMath into my research workflow to experiment with examples, verify conjectures, and analyze algebraic structures that support geometric phenomena.

## Teaching and Outreach

I have experience in teaching and mentoring students through grading undergraduate assignments at **Nankai University**. I also volunteered at the **Glasgow Science Festival**, guiding children in mathematical games to strengthen their problem-solving intuition.  
As part of my future goals, I look forward to contributing to teaching duties by delivering lectures, supervising exercises, and mentoring students.
